Introduction
============

FUME means Fluid Universal Modeling Environment, which aims to provide a convinent programming library for computational fluid dynamics.

It will contain the following parts:
- Mesh management, including mesh specs, grid indexing, grid stagger, etc.
- Mesh decompose for parallel computing
- Time management

It will be written in Fortran targetting high performance computing.
